### Views

Function-Based Views are best suited for handling simple use cases, such as a straightforward form or a page that displays static information.

Class-Based Views shine in more complex scenarios where you might benefit from the object-oriented features like inheritance. They are particularly useful for creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and when you're working with forms and models. Class views are recommended for APIs.

### DRF

DRF is a Django REST Framework library.

It's recommended to start api versioning right off the bat, so future changes don't mess up previous changes.

```py
urlpatterns = [
    path('api/v1/my_endpoint/', views.MyEndpointV1.as_view()),
    path('api/v2/my_endpoint/', views.MyEndpointV2.as_view()),
]
```
