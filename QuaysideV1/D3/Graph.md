# D3 Basics

**3/6/2024 â€¢ Mya Schroder**

[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a javascript library for making graphs. We want to swap to it for our task tree to give it a modern feel and allow more interaction.

From my understanding, D3 renders graphs as SVGs which you can make and modify through attribute manipulation. I was initially confused where all these attributes were in the D3 documentation. It turns out, these attributes refers to SVG attributes, which can be found in the [SVG docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute).
